## About the Project

LogicLens is a component-based, responsive portfolio website that demonstrates technical proficiency while maintaining a photographer's eye for aesthetics. The project emphasizes clean architecture, accessibility, and seamless user experience across all devices.

**Tech Stack:**
- **HTML5** — Semantic markup with ARIA labels for accessibility
- **CSS3** — Custom properties (CSS Variables), Grid & Flexbox layouts
- **Vanilla JavaScript** — No frameworks, pure DOM manipulation
- **FontAwesome 6.5.1** — Icon library for visual enhancement

**Design Philosophy:**
- Mobile-first responsive design (320px to 1200px+)
- Component-based CSS architecture with isolated, reusable modules
- Dark mode by default with persistent theme switching
- Performance-optimized with minimal dependencies

- **Dynamic Scrollbar** — Custom-styled scrollbar that adapts to the active theme
- **Smooth Scrolling** — Enhanced navigation with scroll-triggered header effects
- **Project Showcase** — Gallery featuring Java Calculator, Python To-Do List, and Blog Template
